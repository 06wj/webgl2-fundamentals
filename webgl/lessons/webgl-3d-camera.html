    <h1>WebGL 3D - Cameras</h1>
    <p>This post is a continuation of a series of posts about WebGL.
The first <a href="webgl-fundamentals.html">started with fundamentals</a> and
the previous was about <a href="webgl-3d-perspective.html">3D perspective projection</a>.
If you haven't read those please view them first.</p>
<p>In the last post we had to move the F in front of the frustum because the <code>makePerspective</code>
fucntion expects it sits at the origin (0, 0, 0) and that objects in the frustum are -zNear
to -zFar in front of it.</p>
<p>Moving stuff in front of the view doesn't seem the right way to go does it? In the real world
you usually move your camera to take a picture of a build.</p>

<p>You don't usually move the buildings to be in front of the camera.</p>

<div class="webgl_center">moving the objects to the camera</div>

<p>But in our last post we came up with projection that requires things to be
in front of the origin on the -Z axis.  To achieve this what we want to do
is move the camera to the origin and move everything else the right amount
so it's still in the same place <em>relative to the camera</em>.</p>

<p>We need to effectively move the world in front of the camera.  The easiest
way to do this is to use an "inverse" matrix.  The math to compute an
inverse matrix in the general case is complex but conceptually it's easy.
The inverse is the value you'd use to negate some other value.  For
example, the inverse of 123 is -123.  The inverse of a scale matrix that
scaled by 5 would be 1/5th or 0.2.  The inverse of a matrix that rotated
30&deg; in X would be one that rotates -30&deg; in X.</p>
<p>Up until this point we've used translation, rotation and scale to affect
the position and orientation of our 'F'.  After multiplying all the
matrices together we have a single matrix that represents how to move the
'F' from the origin to the place, size and orientation we want it.  We can
do the same for a camera.  Once we have the matrix that tells us how to
move and rotate the camera from the origin to where we want it we can
compute its inverse which will give us a matrix that tells us how to move
and rotate everything else the opposite amount which will effectively make
it so the camera is at (0, 0, 0) and we've moved everything in front of
it.</p>
<p>Let's make a 3D scene with a circle of 'F's like the diagrams above.</p>
<p>Here's the code.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  var numFs = 5;
  var radius = 200;

  // Compute the projection matrix
  var aspect = canvas.width / canvas.height;
  var projectionMatrix =
      makePerspective(fieldOfViewRadians, aspect, 1, 2000);

  // Draw 'F's in a circle
  for (var ii = 0; ii < numFs; ++ii) {
    var angle = ii * Math.PI * 2 / numFs;

    var x = Math.cos(angle) * radius;
    var z = Math.sin(angle) * radius;
    var translationMatrix = makeTranslation(x, 0, z);

    // Multiply the matrices.
    var matrix = translationMatrix;
    matrix = matrixMultiply(matrix, projectionMatrix);

    // Set the matrix.
    gl.uniformMatrix4fv(matrixLocation, false, matrix);

    // Draw the geometry.
    gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 16 * 6);
  }
</pre>

<p>Just after we compute our projection matrix let's compute a camera that
goes around the 'F's like in the diagram above.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  // Compute the camera's matrix
  var cameraMatrix = makeTranslation(0, 0, radius * 1.5);
  cameraMatrix = matrixMultiply(
      cameraMatrix, makeYRotation(cameraAngleRadians));
</pre>

<p>We then compute a "view matrix" from the camera matrix.  A "view matrix"
is the matrix that moves everything the opposite of the camera effectively
making everything relative to the camera as though the camera was at the
origin (0,0,0)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  // Make a view matrix from the camera matrix.
  var viewMatrix = makeInverse(cameraMatrix);
</pre>

<p>Finally we need to apply the view matrix when we compute the matrix for each 'F'</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    // Multiply the matrices.
    var matrix = translationMatrix;
    matrix = matrixMultiply(matrix, viewMatrix);  // <=-- added
    matrix = matrixMultiply(matrix, projectionMatrix);
</pre>

<p>And wahlah! A camera that goes around the circle of 'F's. Drag the <code>cameraAngle</code> slider
to move the camera around.</p>

<p>That's all fine but using rotate and translate to move a camera where you want it and point toward
what you want to see is not always easy. For example if we wanted the camera to always point
at a specific one of the 'F's it would take some pretty crazy math to compute how to rotate the
camera to point at that 'F' while it goes around the circle of 'F's.</p>
<p>Fortunately there's an easier way. We can just decide where we want the camera and what we want it to point at
and then compute a matrix that will put the camera there. Based on how matrices work this is surpurisingly easy.</p>
<p>First we need to know where we want the camera or eye, your eye being a
biological camera.  We'll call this the <code>cameraPosition</code>.  Then we need to
know the positon of the thing we want to look at or aim at.  We'll call it
the target.  If we subtract the <code>target</code>from the <code>cameraPosition</code> we'll
have a vector that points in the direction we'd need to go from the camera
to get to the target.  Let's call it <code>zAxis</code>. Since we know the
camera points in the -Z direction we can just copy those value,
normalized, directly into the z part of the matrix.</p>
<div class="webgl_math_center"><pre class="webgl_math">

|    |    |    |    |

</pre></div>

<p>This part of a matrix represents the Z axis.  In this case the Z-axis of
the camera.  Normalizing a vector means making it a vector that represents
1.0.  If you go back to the 2D rotation article where we talked about unit
circles and how thosehelped with 2D rotation, in 3D we need unit spheres
and a normalized vector represents a point on a unit sphere.</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="resources/cross-product-diagram.html?mode=0" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p>That's not enough info though.  Just a single vector gives us a point on a
unit sphere but which orientation from that point to orient things.  We
need to fill out the other parts of the matrix.  Specificaly the X axis
and Y axis parts.  We know for a camera these 3 parts are perpendicular to
each other.  We also know that "in general" we don't point the camera100
straight up.  Given that, if we know which way is up, in this case 0,1,0,
We can use that and something called a "cross product~to compute the X
axis and Y axis for the matrix.</p>
<p>I have no idea what a cross product means in mathmatical terms.  What I do
know is that if you have 2 unit vectors and you compute the cross product
of them you'll get a vector that is perpendicular to those 2 vectors.  In
other words, if you have a vector pointing south east, and a vector
pointing up,and you compute the cross product you'll get a vector pointing
either north west since that is purpendicular to south east and up.  Note,
depending on which orderyou compute the cross product you'll get the
opposite answer.  In otherwords, given our sample there are 2 vectors that
are purpendicular to south east vs up. North east and north west.</p>
<p>In any case if we compute the cross product of our <code>zAxis</code> and
<code>up</code> we'll get the X axis for the camera.</p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="resources/cross-product-diagram.html?mode=1" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p>And now that we have the <code>xAxis</code> we can cross the <code>zAxis</code> and the <code>zAxis</code>
which will give us the camera's <code>yAxis</code></p>
<iframe class="webgl_example" src="resources/cross-product-diagram.html?mode=2" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

<p>Now all we have to do is plug in the 3 axes into a matrix. That gives as a
matrix that will orient something that points at the <code>target</code> from the
<code>cameraPosition</code>. We just need to add in the <code>position</code></p>
