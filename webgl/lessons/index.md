Title: WebGL2 Fundamentals

WebGL2 from the ground up. No magic.

These are a set of articles that teach WebGL2 from basic principles.
They are NOT old rehashed out of date OpenGL articles like many others on the net.
They are entirely new, discarding the old out of date ideas and bringing you
to a full understanding of what WebGL really is and how it really works.

These articles are specifically about WebGL2.
